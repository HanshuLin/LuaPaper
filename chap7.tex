\chapter{Conclusion \& Future work}
All in all, this paper shows the syntax and semantic of full version of Lua due to our analysis, and thus a simpler version of Lua such we call it Featherweight Lua. FWLua removes a lot of elements and only remains those key components in Lua. What is more, we have deeply focused on the exortic and important features, which are metatables and metamethods. During the research, we found that those factors are very powerful for Lua since they can change behaviors of programming language. They can even model many different kinds of data structure combining the primary data structure in Lua --- tables.

In addition, we also give an approach to desugar Lua into FWLua. Due to this, users can make a clearer understanding about full version of Lua through this exquisite core language. We also give a proto interpreter, using the language of Haskell, as the implementation. In the implementation, our works is partially proved to be right and important.

Finally, the future work would include some further works about completing FWLua due to Lua. Since FWLua is just a core set of full version of Lua, there are still factors in Lua can be treated as core factors due to different directions of research. For example, Lua has planty reserved functions that can control its basic behavior, and it even has a special data type, which is called I/O file according to the reference \cite{PIL}.
