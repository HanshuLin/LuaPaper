\chapter{Featherweight Lua}
Although Lua has a minimal syntax compared to most other programming languages, it is still too complex for formal reasoning. To make it simpler for reading and analyzing, we further simplify the syntax from the full version Lua. We call the new, simplified language {\it Featherweight Lua} (FWLua). In FWLua, we remove unnecessary syntax and reduce the language to its essential core.

In this chapter, we first introduce how we deal with several primary parts in Lua --- expressions and statements. Then, we are going to talk about functions and metatables, which are both key elements of Lua, in more detail in the chapter. Meanwhile, we give the full syntax and evaluation rules after all the elements in FWLua have been specifically introduced.

\section{Expressions in FWLua}
As mentioned before, Lua splits statements and expressions, though they may overlap due to function applications. As the consequence, we merge expressions and statements, and treat both of them as expressions in FWLua. In this section, we discuss expressions in FWLua and why we think these simplifications can remain the true spirit of Lua. 

\subsection{Lua's Expressions}
We keep constant values in the language.
These types include Number, String and Boolean representing values in the original syntax.
There is also a special expression {\tt nil}, similar to {\tt null} in Java and to both {\tt null} and {\tt undefined} in JavaScript.
For simplicity, we treat {\tt nil} as a constant in our evaluation rules.

In the original syntax,
there are several different ways for getting variables.
To make it concrete, we show a program using all three ways for getting variables:

\begin{verbatim}
tbl
tbl.x
tbl["y"]
\end{verbatim}

The first case references a variable name.
The second is a direct table select, using `.'.
This variable expression directly gets the value referenced by the key ``x'' in the specified table ``tbl''.
The last case is an example of a computed table access.
It is similar to the second case, except that Lua allows an expression to dynamically determine the key in the table.

The computed table access case can simulate the other approaches.
Referring to {\tt tbl.x} is identical to {\tt tbl["x"]}.
In the version of Lua 5.2, there is a new feature, which is using a reserved variable {\tt \_ENV} to represent the table of global environment.
Therefore, instead of referring to {\tt x}, we can use {\tt \_ENV.x}.

As a consequence, variables are now represented by a more common format: e\textsubscript{1}[e\textsubscript{2}], which we call it table select. In this format, we only look up the variable e\textsubscript{2} in the table e\textsubscript{1} and return the value (or nil if it doesn't exist). And we can use reserved word ``\_ENV'' to represent the global environment. Specifically,

\begin{verbatim}
tbl
\end{verbatim}
equals to
\begin{verbatim}
_ENV["tbl"]
\end{verbatim}

A table constructor
constructs a new domain with some scoped mutable variables within.
When we invoke ``\{\}'', the compiler allocates a new scope
and creates a new anonymous table, similar to how {\tt new} works in JavaScript.

Lua supports both
unary operators and binary operators, though it is straightforward to treat unary operators as binary operators
with two expressions e\textsubscript{1} and e\textsubscript{2} where e\textsubscript{1} is {\tt nil}.
As a result, we eliminate unary operators from the syntax of FWLua.

The syntax of expressions in Featherweight Lua is presented and discussed in Section \ref{sec: FWLUAsyntax}

\subsection{Lua's Statements}
According to Roberto Ierusalimschy~\cite{PIL},
statements in Lua include assignment, control structures, function calls, and variable declarations.

Our strategy for simplifying statements is to classify them into some syntactic groups, and then choose a basic syntactic format for each of them.
We also remove blocks from our syntax since we can desugar sequences of statements easily, and implement block using lambda function.

We first discuss assignment statements. Apparently, every assignment statement will change the store since it assigns a value to a variable. Also, Lua is built to be a dynamic typed programming language, which means type declarations are not needed in assignment statements. Due to this factor, we can merge all types of assignment statements into one single form. According to the original syntax, there might be some differences in local assignment statements. For instance:

\newpage
\begin{verbatim}
a = 3; --A single assignment statement
b, c, d = 1, 2, 3; --Destructuring assignment
e, f = `hello', {}; --Destructuring assignment for different types
\end{verbatim}

There is also a format of assignment that allows using a list of expressions as either variables or values to complete ``Destructuring Assignment''. However, we choose the basic assignment form without lists or local scope. The other forms can be produced with syntactic sugar.
In Chapter~\ref{chp:luaTranslation} we review the desugaring process in more depth.

Lua also features a large number of control structures. However, these can be represented with functions, following patterns established for the lambda calculus~\cite{TAPL}. For instance, the following are some different kinds of control structures in Lua:

\begin{verbatim}
x = 0
while x ~= 10 do --A while loop
  x = x + 1
  print(x)
end

i = 0
repeat --A repeat loop
  i = i + 1
  print(i)
until
  i == 10

if (x == 0) then 
  print("HelloWorld") --An if statement
else 
  print("ByeWorld")
end
\end{verbatim}

Also, they can be represented using a set of lambda functions. We will further discuss it in the Chapter \ref{chp:luaTranslation}. Consequently, we eliminate these control statements from FWLua.

\section{Integration of Expressions and Statements in Lua}
Finally, we treat every statement as an expression for simplicity in FWLua. However, this means that FWLua is not a true subset of Lua. Consider the following expressions:

\begin{verbatim}
3; --A constant value
x; --A variable
a = b = 10; --Multiple statements
\end{verbatim}

Lua does not allow constants or variables as stand-alone statements, and chained assignments are not supported in Lua. While these are departures from Lua, we feel that they are minor discrepancies between the languages.

\section{Functions}
Functions are used to complete a set of computations and return a value. To define a function in Lua, each of the following statements can be used:

\begin{verbatim}
function foo(x) x = x + 1 return x end --normal function definition
foo = function (x) x = x + 1 return x end --assign a first-class function
\end{verbatim}

We can invoke this function as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
foo(4);
\end{verbatim}

In addition, functions in the full version of Lua provide multiple expressions in the function, both in defining arguments and returning values. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
function inc(x, y)
  x = x + 1;
  y = y + 1;
  return (x, y);
end
\end{verbatim}

We can see that a function can both take more than one argument and return multiple values.

However, we want to keep the syntax for FWLua as simple as we can. Therefore, we represent multiple expressions through desugaring, which we discuss later in this chapter.

Based on the examples above, we then choose to use the syntax of anonymous functions as our primary function syntax in FWLua. Since we have already come up with the syntax of assignment statements, we will combine it with anonymous function definition to define a function with a name. Besides, we restrict functions to one argument and one return value for decreasing unnecessary complexity in the syntax.

However, we have also raised the issue against one special statement called ``return statements''. As we mentioned above, return statements cannot really be called statements. Although Lua allows it appear individually like statements, return statements can only appear as the last statement in a block, and that is the reason why we need to treat them as a special cases in functions. In solving this issue, we decide to make the reserved word {\tt return} as the tail in the function and will use {\tt return nil} instead of no return statement in the block.

As the result, the syntax of function would be like the following:
\begin{verbatim}
function x return e end
\end{verbatim}
In the syntax, {\tt x} represents the argument a function takes (only one allowed), and {\tt e} represents the function body. Functions in FWLua still allow multiple expressions in the body of function through desugaring, outlined in Chapter~\ref{chp:luaTranslation}.

We will talk about some key factors related to functions in the following sections, using some examples to make them easier to comprehend.

\subsection{Scoping}
Before talking about closures in Lua and FWLua, we will show some examples to help understand closures in functions.

\begin{verbatim}
x=42
function foo()
  print(x)
end
function bar()
  local x=100
  foo()
end
bar() --will print 42
\end{verbatim}

The above example shows that Lua uses static or lexical scoping. Lexical scoping means that a stack containing variables in one's outer scope is defined once a function or a block is declared. On the other hand, with dynamic scoping, the compiler goes throughout the whole scope link, and then locates the variable that is being called. The above example is testing Lua's scoping mechanism. Once the function {\tt foo()} is invoked in function {\tt bar()}, Lua finds the value of variable {\tt x} from the stack of function {\tt foo()}, and then find its outer scope. It means the scope in Lua is static and immutable. That is the reason why we also call this ``static scope''. In contrast, if Lua used dynamic scoping, the above example would print 100.

%------MODEIFIED-------
\subsection{Closures}
Closures in a programming language enable functions to access variables in their outer scope. Closures is as important as scoping. It is commonly discussed together with scoping.

For a concrete understanding of closures, consider the following example:
%------END-------
\begin{verbatim}
function foo()
  local x = 0;
  return 
    function() 
      x = x + 1;
      return x; 
    end;
end
bar = foo();
print(bar()) --return 1
print(bar()) --return 2
print((foo())()) --return 1
\end{verbatim}

This shows closures in Lua.
In the example, once the variable {\tt bar} is declared, a stack storing scoping information is created.
In the condition, calling {\tt bar} and {\tt foo()} seems the same. However, they will point to two independent stack in inner environment, just as the above instance shows. In other words, the function {\tt foo()} returns a closure.

For setting variables, we need very exact directions of where FWLua should set values. This is a very interesting and important character in FWLua. We will discuss this issue more in Section~\ref{sec: FWLUAsemantic}, and then introduce our translation from Lua to FWLua in Chapter~\ref{chp:luaTranslation}.

\subsection{Recursion}\label{sec:recursions}

Recursion means that a function can call itself in its body.
Here, we give an example of a recursive function in Lua, {\tt factorial(n)}.

\newpage

\begin{verbatim}
function factorial(n)
  if n == 0 then
    return 1;
  else
    return n * factorial(n-1);
  end
end

print(factorial(5)); --results 120
\end{verbatim}

In the example, we can see that only defining the function {\tt factorial(n)} is not simply enough. For implementing the factorial, it must be called with different argument in the body of itself, and this would be the classic recursive function.

Lua uses a call stack to store local variables in one function, and thus implement recursive functions~\cite{begLua}. Theoretically, when a function itself is called in its body, the interpreter will automatically treat it as just a variable and will further finish it after the function is done. In other words, multiple calls to the same function can be active at the same time without the crashes reporting ``undefined'' in Lua.

This quality in Lua is very helpful for us to give the further abstract syntax in FWLua about function, since functions in FWLua would be more like lambda calculus. Next, we will briefly introduce lambda calculus.

\subsection{Lambda calculus}
The restriction of allowing a function in FWLua to only take one argument comes from the lambda calculus. Lambda calculus is a formal language representing computations based on functions. Function abstraction and function application are the two main parts in the syntax of lambda calculus. 

There are several advantages using lambda calculus: it can capture the essence of functional programming language; it has a minimal syntax while is able to build a very complex features. Functions in FWLua will use the system of lambda calculus. It is because lambda calculus is so powerful that enables us to remove many features, which can be represented using lambda calculus, from the full version of Lua. We will further show the detail in Section \ref{sec:TraFunc}.

In the very basic lambda calculus, the symbol `$\lambda$' means a function, the letter appears after `$\lambda$' means the argument this function takes.
Besides, lambda calculus uses another expression as the body of function to form the function abstraction. In representing a function application, there is also an extra letter behind the function abstraction meaning ``the parameter this function applies''. We can represent functions in FWLua using lambda calculus. For instance, the following is a function application in FWLua:

\begin{verbatim}
(function(x) return x end)(a)
\end{verbatim}

This can be represented as a function application ({\tt $\lambda$x.x a}) using lambda calculus. In the example, the expression {\tt $\lambda$x.x} means the function abstraction, taking argument {\tt x} and returning {\tt x} as the result. Furthermore, the letter {\tt a} shows the variable that this function applies.

Meanwhile, functions taking multiple arguments in Lua are very common. Lambda calculus also gives the solution about this. Based on the syntax, the function taking 2 arguments ({\tt x} and {\tt y}) can be shown as {\tt $\lambda$x.$\lambda$y.y}. However, functions in Lua are far more complex than this, since there may be many features need to be taken into the consideration, such as scoping, closure, or outer environment. We will further talk about how we implement the syntactic desugaring according to the basic lambda calculus in Chapter~\ref{chp:luaTranslation}.


\section{Metatables and metamethods}
Metatables allow us to define behaviors as fallbacks when Lua cannot handle an operation. These operations even include symbols whose behavior we think of as being fixed, such as ``+'' or ``-''.
Also, metamethods in metatables can be automatically invoked once the relative conditions are satisfied. In other words, the behaviors of tables can be further controlled to follow our new rules in the program by using metatables. That is the reason why metatables are such an important characteristic of Lua.

However, metatables can only be set for tables. We cannot assign a metatable to some constant values, like numbers or strings. Those data types are too basic, and changing behaviors of some operator for them will cause the chaos. At least, the authors do not want an equation ``1 + 1'' results in 3. 

Although metatables are a core element in Lua, we represent their behavior as part of the desugaring process, rather than bringing it into the basic semantics of FWLua.
It is because we want to make FWLua as clean and simple as possible.
We encode metatables in the translation phase, which means metatables can be further translated as a special inner table when we desugar Lua into FWLua.

\subsection{Introduction about metatables}
Lua constructs a table without any metatable by default.
However, we can set a metatable to tables.
There are two reserved functions related to metatables: {\tt setmetatable()} and {\tt getmetatable()}. These two functions are used for setting and getting a metatable of a table. 
Lua allows users to set any table as a metatable of other tables. Or, there is a need of C code to manipulate the metatables using other types. However, we will skip studying C in the paper and only discuss the former condition.

\subsection{What's in metatable}
Metamethods are reserved functions with a set of special names in a metatable. These functions can be automatically triggered; hence they are called ``hooks''. Actually, all the computations during programming can be thought as hidden functions. One of the purposes of metamethods is to let developers change the behavior of the programming language to a certain degree.

Furthermore, there are 4 different kinds of metamethods in Lua~\cite{PIL}: arithmetic, relational, library-defined, and table-access. According to their names, each of them carries functions toward different fields. The arithmetic and relational metamethods are mostly responsible for binary operations, and the other two are often for tables and reserved functions. Generally, values in Lua can only take arithmetic and relational metamethods, since what they defined would not change the normal behavior of the programming language. On the other hand, table-access metamethods will possibly change the behavior of tables for several situations.

Figure \ref{fig:metatables} introduces several metamethods we think are important for the research of Lua.
