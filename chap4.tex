\chapter{Operational semantics for Featherweight Lua} \label{chp: syntax and semantic}
%---------------------------------MODIFIED by HANSHU---------------------------------
The operational semantics of Featherweight Lua are deliberately minimal. No hooks or control structures are included in the semantics. Feartherweight Lua has two unique characteristics:
%FIXED: What do you mean by "exact direction"?  Let's discuss.
%FIXED: Tables are an important part of the semantics.  Mention those as well.
users have to exactly set or get a variable in FWLua without any ambiguous direction, and functions in FWLua are lambda functions.
However, tables in FWLua are the primary data structure, just the same as Lua.

\section{Syntax for Featherweight Lua}\label{sec: FWLUAsyntax}
We now give the complete syntax of FWLua. In this section, we introduce the syntax for FWLua in Section~\ref{sec: FWLUAsyntax} and the corresponding semantics in Section~\ref{sec: FWLUAsemantic}.

We have given some figures showing the syntax of expressions and statements separately, and have introduced them in detail before.
Statements do not return any value after being evaluated, while expressions always evaluate to a value.
We simplify our language by
having statements always return a value just like expressions.
While this is a difference from the full version of Lua,
we feel it is a minor change that greatly simplifies the complexity
of our semantics.

The full syntax of Featherweight Lua is given by Figure \ref{fig:FW2Syx}. We can see that there are both old version expressions such as constants and binary operations, and statements. For expressions, we keep registers, constants, and new allocations.
Instead of table select {\tt e\textsubscript{1}[e\textsubscript{2}]}, we use the function {\tt rawget(e\textsubscript{1},e\textsubscript{2})}, where e\textsubscript{1} is the table and e\textsubscript{2} is the key in that table.
Unlike table select, {\tt rawget} has no ``hooks'' that must be considered; table select can therefore be desugared using {\tt rawget}.
A set of hooks also exists in the table assignment statements, so we instead use the raw function {\tt rawset(e\textsubscript{1},e\textsubscript{2},e\textsubscript{3})}, where e\textsubscript{1} also means the table, e\textsubscript{2} means the key, and e\textsubscript{3} means the value that we want to assign.

Finally, we add the syntax for functions, that is {\tt function x return e end} with only one argument {\tt x} and body of function {\tt e}. However, for brevity we adopt the lambda calculus symbol $\lambda$ for a simpler syntax represention to make it easier to read. In other words, the syntax ``{\tt $\lambda$x.e}'' means ``{\tt function x return e end}'' in FWLua. We define it as the function abstraction being used as function definition for the reasons we have mentioned before. 

Also, there is the syntax of function application, and the structure is pretty simple: {\tt e\textsubscript{1}(e\textsubscript{2})}, where e\textsubscript{1} presents the name of function and e\textsubscript{1} means the value this function applies.

Not that there is no Boolean value in the list of constants. Because functions are similar to lambda calculus, the value of true and false can be encoded into specific functions. The reference~\cite{LC} has mainly talked about what these functions look like.

\section{Semantics for Featherweight Lua}\label{sec: FWLUAsemantic}
The full big-step semantics of Featherweight Lua (evaluation rules) is shown by Figure \ref{fig:FW2.1Sem}. In the semantics, there are 5 kinds of runtime variables: store, table, function, value, and name. The variable ``store'' is a table mapping registers to tables. Since we have mentioned that the table is the primary data structure in FWLua, all tables will be stored in the store with specific addresses, which are also ``registers''. Secondary, the variable ``table'' is a table that maps keys and values. ``Function'' is used as functions. The variable ``value'' means all types of values in FWLua. There is also a variable called ``name'' to represent some names using strings.

In the basic evaluation rules, we can see FWLua takes current expressions and stores before evaluating and will return a value and manipulated store when it is done.

{\bf FW-VALUE}: This rule takes the value and returns it, with no other side effects.

{\bf FW-NEW}: This rule allocates a new memory location in the store for a new, empty table {\tt \{\}}. This table is added to the store (register to table), with the key of the new address.  The new address is the resulting value.

%FIXED: The discussion of this rule needs revision -- let's discuss
{\bf FW-RAWGET}: In the evaluation rule of {\tt rawget()},
This semantic shows an important charactor of FWLua: no ambiguous direction. In this evaluation rule, FWLua takes 2 arguaments, which are table and key, for getting a variable in the right place. The first expression in this rule presents a direction, and because there are not any reserved words in FWLua, users need to give an exact direction to FWLua to let it know where it should go.

{\bf FW-RAWSET}: {\tt rawset()} is similar to {\tt rawget()}: it evaluates its 3 arguments in the body and returns them as a table, key, and value at the first step and then attempts to find that table in the store as the second step. The difference is that the executer then adds the pair with key and value into this table if this table exists in the store. Since Lua merges variable declaration and assignment statement into one, {\tt rawset()} now can represent both as the user needs: if the key in the {\tt rawset} function does not already exist in the table, it will be created automatically.

{\bf FW-BINOP}: The evaluation rule for binary operations takes the two operands of the operator, evaluates them to values, and then calculates the final result depending on the expected behavior of the operator\footnote{
  The behavior for most of these operators is straightforward;
  for the sake of brevity, we do not provide exact definitions.
}.
However, different operators may be used in different data types, like {\tt ..} for strings and {\tt +} for numbers. Therefore, there are two functions used for the type checking against operands: {\tt validL(c, op)} for the left hand side and {\tt validR(c, op)} for another side. The evaluation will be done only if the types of both operands are valid.
What is more, the operands in FWLua must be a constant (Number, Boolean, String). It is because tables in Lua need metatables to control their behavior in binary operations. We will place this issue in the desugaring phase and further talk about how we transfer binary operations for table in Lua into FWLua in the section ~\ref{sec:TranslateTabls}.

{\bf FW-FUNC-CALL}: This rule evaluates a function application in FWLua. At the beginning, it evaluates an expression to a function. Then it evaluates the argument of this function.  Finally, it evaluates the function body with the substitution from arguments to values.
