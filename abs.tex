Lua is a small and embeddable language in C/C++, which provide much agility and convenience in using. However, there might be some security holes in Lua that allow malicious code to attack. In this paper, we explore semantics of full Lua with information flow to provide specific security in Lua. In this project, we first research the syntax and semantics of full version Lua. Then we decompose it and deliver the evaluation rules of Full version Lua. Finally we give simpler evaluation rules by getting rid of those sugar or optional stuffs in the full version Lua. In addition, we not only simplify the full version Lua into a more concise version, but also compile it by making a compiler using Haskell to testify our work of Lua. The new version of Lua would include all key elements in full version Lua such as functions, table constructors and metatables.
