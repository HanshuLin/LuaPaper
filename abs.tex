Lua is a small, embedded language to provide scripting in other languages.  Despite a clean, minimal syntax, it is still too complex for formal reasoning.

This thesis develops \emph{Featherweight Lua} (FWLua), following the tradition of languages like Featherweight Java\cite{FWJA} and Featherweight JavaScript\cite{FWJS}.  The goal is to develop a core of language features that, while remaining simple enough for formal reasoning, also remain faithful to the central characteristics of the language.  Specifically for Lua, the core features that are essential for our modeling include:
\begin{itemize}
\item
First-class functions
\item
Tables as the central data construct
\item
\emph{Metatables} that provide various ``hooks'' to change the behavior of tables
\end{itemize}

To further validate this approach, we show how an extensive set of features
from the full Lua programming language can be reduced to FWLua. Finally, we include a reference implementation written in Haskell as a tool for further testing and experimenting with the language. With this research, we provide a basis for future research into the Lua programming language.
